This is a highly applied session that is better explored out using your own computer and the code provided. This report is just a quikc intro for the code you can find [on our GitHub](https://github.com/dtc-coding-dojo/main/tree/master/week_7_ml). There you can find everything you need to do some applied Machine Learning. You can download this repository to your computer using 
```
git clone https://github.com/dtc-coding-dojo/main/tree/master/week_7_ml
```



## Applied Machine Learning in Python
This is our applied machine learning code. Here you will find a little demo script walking you through the basics of unsupervised and supervised Machine learning. I have annotated the code pretty thoroughly to make it digestible. If there are any additional questions please direct them at nicolas.arning@bdi.ox.ac.uk. If you have no experience in ML I highly recommend reading our report [here](https://dtc-coding-dojo.github.io/main//blog/Machine_Learning_for_Beginners/). 

All the coding done here is done in scikit-learn which is an easy to handle Machine Learning library which has myriads of features. If you want to know more about the specific algorithms applied here I would recommend looking them up on the sklearn [user guide](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/user_guide.html)

When you go through the code of ML_demo.py it's probably a good idea to comment out most of the lines and just run a bit of the code to see what it does. So with all that said just go ahead and dive right in.
